To play a game of Necromunda, you need models, a battlefield with terrain, and a few essential items listed below.

Markers[​](#markers "Direct link to Markers")
---------------------------------------------

Markers, or tokens, are used to represent the following things:

*   Ready status (a token at the start of the turn, which is removed when they activate)
*   a model’s [Status](https://necrovox.org/docs/general-principles/status) (eg Out of Ammo, Blaze)
*   a modified [Condition](https://necrovox.org/docs/general-principles/conditions)
*   keep track Flesh Wounds, Wounds or Hull Points (some player place this next to the fighter, others prefer to place it on their [Fighter card](https://necrovox.org/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/fighter-profiles#fighter-cards))

Templates[​](#templates "Direct link to Templates")
---------------------------------------------------

In Necromunda, templates are used to represent the effect of certain weapons:

### Blast Markers[​](#blast-markers "Direct link to Blast Markers")

A circular marker in two diameters: 3" and 5". Mainly used by weapons with the Blast trait. This'll be shown as Blast (3") or Blast (5"). [Grenades](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/grenades) are a common example.

### Flame Templates[​](#flame-templates "Direct link to Flame Templates")

A teardrop shaped template roughly 8" in length. Mainly used by weapons with the Template trait. These weapons will have a Short Range Profile of "T", for example a [Flamer](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/special-weapons#flamer).

Ruler/Tape Measure[​](#rulertape-measure "Direct link to Ruler/Tape Measure")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Necromunda is British, and used inches (") for all its measurements.

**Pre-measuring distances when making any kind of action is not allowed!** Declare the action and nominate any other fighters involved before range is measured.

Vision Arc Template[​](#vision-arc-template "Direct link to Vision Arc Template")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each model has a vision arc, which is 90 degrees directly in front of them. A starter box has a template you can use for this. Some people paint the limits of their vision arc on a model's base, but most people simply use common sense (eg where the model or the model's chest is facing).

Fighter and Vehicle Cards[​](#fighter-and-vehicle-cards "Direct link to Fighter and Vehicle Cards")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each fighter and vehicle that makes up a gang has a card which lists its characteristics and rules.

Necromunda Dice[​](#necromunda-dice "Direct link to Necromunda Dice")
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Necromunda uses several different types of dice to determine the outcome of various actions and events. These are:

*   **D6:** Your standard six-sided dice.
*   **D3:** Roll a D6, then half the result rounding up.
    *   1-2 is a 1
    *   3-4 is a 2
    *   5-6 is a 3.
*   **Firepower Dice:** a six-sided dice which is used when a fighter makes a range attack. For most weapons, this will check to see if the weapon needs to make an ammo check. If a weapon has Rapid Fire, it determines how many shots the weapon can make.  
    To proxy this dice with a D6,
    *   1 is a single shot with ammo check
    *   2-3 is a single shot
    *   4-5 is two shots
    *   6 is three shots
*   **Scatter Dice:** a six-sided dice with a a Hit symbol (with a small arrow inside) on two faces and an arrow on each of the other four. Used to determine random directions, mainly with a blast weapon.
*   **Injury Dice:** a six-sided dice used to determine how badly injured a fighter is after receiving damage.  
    To proxy this dice with a D6,
    *   1 is Out of Action
    *   2-4 is Seriously Injured
    *   5-6 is a Flesh Wound
*   **Location Dice (Vehicles):** a six-sided dice used to determine where a vehicle is hit.  
    To proxy this dice with a D6,
    *   1-3 is Body
    *   4 is Drive
    *   5 is Engine
    *   6 is Crew
*   **Damage Dice (Vehicles):** a six-sided dice used to determine how badly a vehicle has been hit. To proxy this dice with a D6,
    *   1-3 is a Glancing hit
    *   4-5 is a Penetrating hit
    *   6 is a Catastrophic hit.
*   **Control Dice (Vehicles):** a six-sided dice used to determine what happens when a vehicle loses control. The direction on the arrows don't matter (you roll a D6 afterwards to determine the direction: 1-3 is left, 4-6 is right). To proxy this dice with a D6,
    *   1-3 is a Swerve
    *   4-5 is a Jackknife
    *   6 is a Roll
