Weapon Profiles[​](#weapon-profiles-1 "Direct link to Weapon Profiles")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the same way as a fighter, each weapon has its own characteristics profile, detailing the range of its attacks, the damage it deals and so forth. For example, here is the profile of a heavy stubber:


|             |Range|Accuracy|   |   |   |   |   |   |                        |   |           |
|-------------|-----|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|------------------------|---|-----------|
|Weapon       |S    |L       |S  |L  |S  |AP |D  |Am |Traits                  |AL |Credit Cost|
|Heavy stubber|20"  |40"     |-  |-1 |4  |-1 |1  |4+ |Rapid Fire (2), Unwieldy|R7 |130        |

Weapon Profiles appear slightly differently on Necrodamus, for the sake of brevity.


|Weapon       |Rg S|Rg L|Ac S|Ac L|S  |AP |D  |Am |Traits                  |AL |Cost|

|Heavy stubber|20" |40" |-   |-1  |4  |-1 |1  |4+ |Rapid Fire (2), Unwieldy|R7 |130 |

A weapon’s characteristics are defined as follows:

### Range (Rng)[​](#range-rng "Direct link to Range (Rng)")

Each weapon has two ranges: Short (S) and Long (L), usually presented as a number of inches. Weapons cannot hit models outside of their Long range. There may be other effects associated with an attack being within either the Long or Short range of a weapon, these will be described when they come up.

Some weapon ranges are shown as a letter rather than a number of inches. If a weapon’s range is listed as an ‘E’, it can only be used in close combat against targets that are Engaged with the wielder. If a weapon’s range is ‘T’, it uses the [Flame template](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/shooting#flame-templates). Weapons with range E or T normally only have a Long range given, not a Short range, indicating that this is the furthest range at which the weapon can be used.

### Accuracy (Acc)[​](#accuracy-acc "Direct link to Accuracy (Acc)")

This shows the modifiers that are applied to the hit roll when attacking with the weapon within Short range or Long range. The ‘S’ modifier applies if the weapon is being used to attack a target within its Short range, and the ‘L’ modifier applies if the weapon is being used to attack a target beyond Short range but within Long range. Most such modifiers are positive, but some may be negative.

### Strength (Str)[​](#strength-str "Direct link to Strength (Str)")

This is the weapon’s Strength, which is used when making wound rolls against the target. For most weapons, particularly ranged weapons, this is a simple number. For close combat weapons – those with a range of E – this may be shown as ‘S’, meaning the Strength of the wielder should be used, or as S with a modifier, meaning the Strength of the wielder is used but with a modifier applied.

### Armour Piercing (AP)[​](#armour-piercing-ap "Direct link to Armour Piercing (AP)")

This shows how good the weapon is at punching through a target’s armour. This is a modifier which is applied to the dice rolled to make an armour save. Most often, this will be a negative modifier, but in some cases it may be a positive modifier or even a ‘-’ which denotes no modifier.

### Damage (D)[​](#damage-d "Direct link to Damage (D)")

This represents how much damage the weapon inflicts. This in turn indicates how many Wounds a fighter loses or how many Injury dice are rolled against them as a result of the attack. This is explained in more detail in [Inflicting Damage](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#3-inflict-damage). Against a vehicle it determines how many Damage dice are rolled. This is explained in more detail in [Resolving Hits Aginst Vehicles: Making Wound Rolls](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#2-make-wound-roll).

### Ammo (Am)[​](#ammo-am "Direct link to Ammo (Am)")

If this characteristic is presented as a target number, a Firepower dice must be rolled as well as the hit dice when attacking with it, as there is a chance of it running Out of Ammo, jamming or otherwise malfunctioning. This is explained in more detail in [Resolving Hits: The Firepower Dice](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/shooting#the-firepower-dice).

### Traits[​](#traits "Direct link to Traits")

Most weapons have one or more Traits, each of which gives the weapon a unique bonus or changes the way in which it works.

### Availability Level (Al)[​](#availability-level-al "Direct link to Availability Level (Al)")

This indicates how easily available a weapon is from the Trading Post, either Rare (R), Illegal (I) or Exclusive (E). This is explained in more detail in [The Post-Battle Sequence: Visiting the Trading Post](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#b-visit-the-trading-post).

### Credit Cost[​](#credit-cost "Direct link to Credit Cost")

This indicates how much it costs to purchase the weapon from the Trading Post. This is explained in more detail in [The Post-Battle Sequence: Visiting the Trading Post](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#b-visit-the-trading-post).
