# INTRODUCTION

Necromunda is a sprawling, evolving game, and has had a lot of rules published since this version came out in 2017.

These rules vary across publications, and some even contradict each other. This is where the community has stepped in, and created compilations to keep the game playable.

The goal of this website is to make the rules clear and accessible, so Necromunda can reach a wider audience. It is a compilation of all content from the 2017 release onwards.

**While originally based on the Necrodamus rules compilation, this has evolved over time. The website is now in the process of being rewritten as to not infringe on GW copyright.**

All original content is owned by Games Workshop and published here without permission. When you buy a gang, please buy their House/Book as well! Necromunda is all about the narrative, and each book features fantastic backstories and fluff that elevate the title far beyond the core game mechanics.

Throughout these page you may see box-outs. Here are some examples that you will see that are not from the original rules:
